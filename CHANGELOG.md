## Unreleased

### Added

* Ability to add autogenerated note block with parametrized text that by defaults point to source file location.
* `convert` command now takes into account parameters from `.text2conf.yml` file
* Support for orphaned child pages removal using 2 strategies:
  * `managed` (default) - to remove pages only created by `text2confl` itself. It is good to clear dangling pages after rename while allowing humans to maintain pages under generated ones
  * `all` - to remove all child pages. It is good if you want to enforce policy that all pages should be managed in code  

## 0.2.0 - 2022-02-12

### Added

* Ability to override parent via page attributes. This can be handy for use-cases when root pages do not belong to single
  parent
* \[Markdown] Support for status macro via custom html tag: `<status color="red">STATUS text</status>`
* \[Markdown] Support for confluence username reference (`@username`)
* \[Markdown] Support for ^superscript^ text

### Fixed

* \[Confluence Cloud] Creation of page - turns out cloud version sets editor property on page creation, so call to
  create this property fails
* \[Confluence Cloud] Fixed line soft wraps. Editor v2 does paragraph breaks on soft wraps that is undesirable
* Space details resolution used hardcoded space key, now provided key is used properly

## 0.1.0 - 2022-02-06

Initial release of application.
